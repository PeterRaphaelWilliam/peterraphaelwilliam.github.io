    <h2>Important People in My Life</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Godfrey Stanley Mkoba</strong> – My closest friend from Muungano Primary School (Std 1–5). He taught me about PlayStation games and sparked my love for Dorcas.</li>
      <li><strong>Michael Albert Shomari</strong> – A close friend who inspired my love for music and football. He really tried to connect me with Dorcas, though I was too shy 😅.</li>
      <li><strong>Adam Sadiki Rashid</strong> – A fun and mischievous classmate. His jokes were sometimes too much 🤣, but unforgettable.</li>
      <li><strong>Tumaini Masaro Selemani</strong> – A good friend who taught me how to play cards and marbles. One of my closest buddies.</li>
      <li><strong>Coolvet Japheth Luka</strong> – A playful friend. We would joke, argue, and even go silent, but he always brought joy into my life. 😜</li>
      <li><strong>Mwanaidi Said Rajabu</strong> – My cousin and classmate. I see her as a dear sister and truly special person. 🤗</li>
      <li><strong>Godfrey Elias Kimenya</strong> – A gentle, quiet friend. We used to tease him for his calmness 😂, but he’ll never be forgotten.</li>
      <li><strong>Dorcas Shaban Mussa</strong> – A beautiful soul who changed my life completely. She is my inspiration, and every dream I pursue is for her. ❤️</li>
